# Category Classification With Hybrid Classification Approach and Bookkeeping Chatbot API

A FastAPI based application that classifies financial transactions from CSV files and also provides a conversational AI chatbot to answer bookkeeping related queries. This project leverages a hybrid classification framework combining Regular Expressions (Regex), Sentence Transformers with Logistic Regression, and Large Language Models (LLM) to categorize transactions, alongside a simple basic chatbot powered by LangChain, Chroma, and Groq’s LLaMA model for natural language queries.

## Features

Transaction Classification: Upload a CSV file with transaction descriptions and amounts to automatically categorize them (e.g., "Travel," "Utilities," "Unclassified").
Chatbot Interface: Ask questions about your transaction data, such as:
"How many unclassified transactions are in the file?"
"How much was spent on Travel in March?"
Persistent Vector Store: Uses Chroma to store transaction embeddings for efficient retrieval.

## Classification Approaches

The hybrid classification framework employs three complementary methods:

1. Regular Expression (Regex):
   - Handles the most simplified and predictable patterns.
   - Useful for patterns easily captured using predefined rules (e.g., "UBER" → "Travel").
2. Sentence Transformer + Logistic Regression:
   - Manages complex patterns when sufficient training data is available.
   - Utilizes embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers and applies Logistic Regression as the classification layer.
3. Large Language Models (LLM):
   - Used for handling complex patterns when sufficient labeled training data is not available.
   - Provides a fallback or complementary approach to enhance accuracy and flexibility.
